# Chat Assistant

A Python-based chat assistant that interacts with an SQLite database to answer user queries.

## How It Works
- The assistant accepts natural language queries.
- It converts queries into SQL to fetch data from the database.
- It responds with clear, formatted answers.

## Running the Project
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies.
3. Run the Flask app: `python app.py`.
4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

## Known Limitations
- Limited natural language processing capabilities.
- Supports only a predefined set of queries.

## Suggestions for Improvement
- Integrate a more advanced NLP model for better query parsing.
- Add a frontend interface for a better user experience.
